      I absolutely love the song "Blinding Lights" by The Weeknd! The lyrics and beat of the song always get me in a great mood. Below are the lyrics to the song:<br><br>
      I've been tryna call<br>
      I've been on my own for long enough<br>
      Maybe you can show me how to love, maybe<br>
      I'm going through withdrawals<br>
      You don't even have to do too much<br>
      You can turn me on with just a touch, baby<br><br>

      I look around and<br>
      Sin City's cold and empty (oh)<br>
      No one's around to judge me (oh)<br>
      I can't see clearly when you're gone<br><br>

      I said, ooh, I'm blinded by the lights<br>
      No, I can't sleep until I feel your touch<br>
      I said, ooh, I'm drowning in the night<br>
      Oh, when I'm like this, you're the one I trust<br>
      Hey, hey, hey<br><br>

      I'm running out of time<br>
      'Cause I can see the sun light up the sky<br>
      So I hit the road in overdrive, baby, oh<br>
      The city's cold and empty (oh)<br>
      No one's around to judge me (oh)<br>
      I can't see clearly when you're gone<br><br>

      I said, ooh, I'm blinded by the lights<br>
      No, I can't sleep until I feel your touch<br>
      I said, ooh, I'm drowning in the night<br>
      Oh, when I'm like this, you're the one I trust<br>
      I'm just calling back to let you know (back to let you know)<br>
      I could never say it on the phone (say it on the phone)<br>
      Will never let you go this time (ooh)<br>
      I said, ooh, I'm blinded by the lights<br>
      No, I can't sleep until I feel your touch<br>
      Hey, hey, hey<br>
    </p>
